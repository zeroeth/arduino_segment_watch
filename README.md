BigTime Watch Source
====================

This is an on-going firmware replacement for the big time watch sold at Maker Faire NY 2011.

The goal is to add functionality for timers, alarms, stop watches, and a trip count-down (based on an input MPH)

Current code works to update the time every second and go in to a deep sleep otherwise.
